# EnigmaMaze
# maze-run game in unity
My Unity project was programmed in C#, 3 scenes can be found in the project, which are changed depending on the course of the game. The playable character is a cube that you can move and you have to find all six keys in a given time

The packages used in my c# camera.cs script: 
System, 
System.Collections, 
System.Collections.Generic, 
UnityEngine, 
TMPro, 
UnityEngine.UT, 
UnityEngine.SceneManagement

To play, download My Project (5) and run it on your PC. It will work on Mac, Windows and Linux
